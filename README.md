# Ontario Health Teams

The Ontario Health Teams are newly created multi-sectoral healthcare teams in Ontario. OHTs are working closely with vendors and communities to develop and support digital health solutions that facilitate innovation and collaboration across OHTs and regions. I will be uploading public information related to the OHTs and digital health. Please feel free to contact me for more information.
